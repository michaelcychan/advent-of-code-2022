Advent of Code, created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.  

I am joining the Advent of Code because it is a fun way to practice coding. I am attempting to use different languages so that I can take this opportunity to learn something new every day.
